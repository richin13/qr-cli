# qr-cli

Tool to create QR codes from the command line.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/richin13/qr-cli.git
cd qr-cli
cargo build --release
./target/release/qr-cli --help
```

It can print the QR to the console or write it to a PNG image.


## Why?

There are a ton of tools and online websites that can generate QR codes. But I wanted to create one that I could use from the command line for extra privacy.
